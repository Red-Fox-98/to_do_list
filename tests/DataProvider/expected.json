Star Wars: Maul \u2014 Shadow Lord was originally announced at Star Wars Celebration in 2025, and is set after Maul's arc in Star Wars: The Clone Wars but before his appearance in Star Wars: Rebels.The 10-episode series covers Maul's plot to rebuild his criminal syndicate \"on a planet untouched by the Empire,\" according to Lucasfilm. \"There, he crosses paths with a disillusioned young Jedi Padawan who may just be the apprentice he is seeking to aid him in his relentless pursuit for revenge.\" Shadow Lord will premiere with two episodes on April 6, and will stream two episodes a week on Disney+ through May 6.Like most of Disney's popular animated Star Wars shows, Maul \u2014 Shadow Lord is created by Dave Filoni, a George Lucas supplicant, co-creator of The Clone Wars and newly minted President and Chief Creative Officer at Luscafilm. Besides picking up the story threads he helped establish in his previous animated work, Maul \u2014 Shadow Lord could be representative of the work that will define his tenure: stories that play in the pre-existing Star Wars sandbox.Since completing their sequel trilogy in 2019 with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Disney and Lucasfilm have struggled to define what the future of their franchise will actually be. New projects have languished in pre-production, interesting TV shows have gotten cancelled and the only things that seem to come out with any consistency are spin-offs of The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars. Disney and Lucasfilm will release The Mandalorian and Grogu on May 22, 2026, the first new Star Wars movie to hit theaters in seven years.

Its business model revolves around giving customers free dual-screen televisions where the lower screen shows non-stop advertisements. At the time, the start-up\u2019s execs projected that Telly would ship its first 500,000 screens that summer. However, Janko Roettgers of Lowpass reported that Telly only had 35,000 sets in people's homes at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The figure appears to come from a quarterly investor update, but Telly didn't provide Roettgers with any comment on the report.Personally, I don't think I'd want a free TV that perpetually pelts me with ads, but it seems Telly did in fact have some interest in its approach; the company reportedly had 250,000 pre-orders in June 2023. However, it ran into issues with getting those televisions to customers in one piece. The quarterly report allegedly said that 10 percent of Telly's shipments through FedEx arrived broken. A thread on the company's Reddit page from a year ago backs that up, chronicling delayed shipments and broken replacements. So in short, things aren\u2019t going so great for the company right now."},{"title":"David Ellison extends deadline for Warner Bros. Discovery takeover offer","text":"Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison is apparently still hopeful that investors will approve his $108.4 billion hostile takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery. Paramount Skydance announced Thursday that it's extending its all-cash offer to acquire the storied studio, and giving investors until February 20, 2026 to accept. The company's previous offer expired on January 21, but with a lawsuit in the works and a revised Netflix deal to compete with, Paramount Skydance wants to stay in the conversation.Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery originally announced their $82.7 billion acquisition agreement in December 2025. Netflix's deal is for a significant portion, but notably not all, of Warner Bros. Discovery as it exists today. If approved, the streaming service would acquire Warner Bros. film studios, New Line Cinema, HBO, HBO Max, the company's theme parks, game studios and select linear channels like TNT, but not the collection of reality TV and news programming that Warner Bros. Discovery calls \u201cGlobal Networks.\u201dParamount Skydance made its competing offer of $108.4 billion for all of Warner Bros. Discovery a few days later in December, with the recommendation that shareholders reject the Netflix deal. To add pressure, Paramount Skydance also sued Warner Bros. Discovery in January alleging that the company had not provided adequate information about why it favored Netflix over Paramount. Beyond offering more money, Paramount contends its deal is more likely to be approved by regulators because owning Warner Bros. doesn't \"entrench Netflix's market dominance.\" Warner Bros. Discovery claims that funding for Paramount's deal \"remains inadequate\" and that the company is uncertain Paramount Skydance will actually be able to complete the deal.David Ellison was previously able to merge Skydance with Paramount using the financial backing of his billionaire father Larry Ellison, and the Ellison family's friendly relationship with the Trump administration. Promising to make sure that CBS News represents \"a diversity of viewpoints\u201d via a newly appointed ombudsman, and that the merged Paramount Skydance won't create any diversity, equity and inclusion programs was enough to get the FCC to approve the merger. Ellison might have thought acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery would be equally easy, but at least so far that hasn't worked out as planned."},{"title":"Fable will let you be a heartless landlord this fall","text":"After half a decade of waiting, Microsoft finally offered an extended preview of its long-awaited reboot of the beloved Fable RPG franchise on Thursday. During the company\u2019s recent Developer Direct showcase, Playground Games, best known for its works on the Forza Horizon series, shared nearly 11 minutes of gameplay footage and commentary related to the upcoming title. The new game will feature a fully open world for players to explore, with locations from previous Fable games like Bowerstone making a return.Playground didn\u2019t say exactly where the new game takes place in the Fable timeline. If you played 2010\u2019s Fable 3, you may recall there was a time gap between each of the original games, with the final Lionhead entry giving players the chance to explore a version of Albion that\u2019s been thrown into the tumult of an industrial revolution. This new game appears to offer a more traditional Medieval fantasy setting.From what little Playground shared of the story, the player character is the first hero born in Albion in a generation. Like previous Fable games, their story will begin when they\u2019re a child. They\u2019ll leave their home of Briar Hill after a \u201cmysterious stranger\u201d turns all the inhabitants into stone. Before you set off on your adventure, you\u2019ll be able to decide what your hero looks like, with customization including options for different skin tones, head shapes, tattoos and scars.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_lgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_lgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }Advertisement#_R_15gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (min-width: 768px) { #_R_15gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }All pretty standard stuff, and combat doesn\u2019t look groundbreaking. Your character can use a combination of melee and ranged weapons, alongside magic, to defeat their foes. In addition to a health bar, enemies appear to have a posture meter players can break through both light and heavy attacks, before carrying out \u201cstylish\u201d finishers. Judging from the footage Playground shared, combat doesn\u2019t quite have the kinetic feel of say a FromSoftware title.Thankfully, there\u2019s more to the game than just fighting monsters. Like past Fable games, players can ask villagers out on dates, before eventually marrying them and having children, and you\u2019re not limited to a monogamous relationship. It looks like Playground built a modern polycule simulator. Beyond that, you can also purchase every house and business in Albion. The game\u2019s NPCs will develop an opinion of your hero and their actions. Say you evict an artist that lived in one of the houses you bought, you can later meet them on the street and they\u2019ll tell you to your face that you\u2019re awful. Wonderful stuff.From a technical perspective, the footage Playground showed off looked on the rough side. The game\u2019s frame rate and frame pacing wasn\u2019t smooth, and I\u2019m pretty sure I saw ghosting in some of the animations. Hopefully the studio has enough time between now and when the game is finally released sometime this autumn to polish the presentation. When the game does arrive, it will be available on Xbox Series X\/S, PC via Xbox and Steam, PlayStation 5 and Game Pass Ultimate.Microsoft first announced a new Fable game was in development back in 2020. It then went three years before sharing a preview of the title, which was originally slated to arrive in 2025 before it was delayed to this year last February."},{"title":"Double Fine announces delightful-looking multiplayer pottery game Kiln","text":"Double Fine has been on a tear with its smaller projects lately. The popular indie game developer is following up last year's atmospheric adventure game Keeper with a new title in a totally different direction. As its Double Fine founder Tim Schaefer attempted to say five times fast during today's Xbox Developer Direct, Kiln is an \"online multiplayer pottery party brawler\" that boasts exactly the sort of colorful, clever fun that fans have come to expect from the studio.Kiln is a game with two facets: creation and destruction. On the creation side, players get to design a ceramic vessel of their choosing, anything from a dainty saucer to a massive vat. From the clips showed, this riff on character creation imitates many of the real processes of throwing on the wheel. There are options to decorate your vessel with glazes and stickers for additional personalization.Once you've made your pottery creation, it's time to destroy it. The game mode that Double Fine showed off during the Developer Direct is called Quench. In these capture-the-flag style matches, your teammates are trying to carry water in the vessels they've designed to the enemy's kiln, where the goal is to douse its flames before opponents can do the same to yours. Different vessel types have different attacks for smashing enemy ceramics to shards, so there can be a strategic angle to building up a smart team composition with a mix of defensive and offensive capabilities.Kiln looks like a really fun time, and it is due out in spring 2026. The game will be available on Xbox Series X\/S, PlayStation 5 and Steam, as well as through Xbox programs such as Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Cloud Gaming."},{"title":"Substack now has a TV app","text":"It was only 16 months ago that Substack expanded into live video.

Starting today, you can install a new Substack TV app on Apple TV and Google TV devices.Substack describes the app's initial launch as focusing on \"reliable, high-quality viewing\" for the platform's long-form videos. It centers around video posts and livestreams from the creators and publications you follow. There's also a \"For You\" section that combines those videos with algorithmic recommendations. And you can browse dedicated pages for each channel.Viewing access aligns with your subscription level. So, if a channel restricts videos to paying subscribers on Substack\u2019s mobile app and website, the same paywall applies here. However, the company says it's working on adding previews of paid content for free subscribers. It also plans to add audio posts, search, improved discovery and separate sections for different shows within a single publication.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_cgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_cgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }At least one of those legacy media expats who moved to Substack is optimistic about the feature. \"This is a game-changing moment for the rise of independent media,\" former CNN anchor Jim Acosta wrote in the announcement post. \"Substack has proven that legacy media consumers are not only searching for fresh alternatives; they are finding them.\"Based on the comments in Substack\u2019s announcement, some of the platform\u2019s die-hards are less enthusiastic than Acosta. \u201cFile this under \u2013 thing we didn\u2019t ask for,\u201d Ashli Pollard wrote. \u201cThis is not YouTube,\u201d a commenter named Dustin added. \u201cElevate the written word.\u201d I personally don\u2019t see any harm in another way to watch the videos Substack already hosts. (Its newsletters aren\u2019t going anywhere.) But given how Big Tech companies tend to pivot further toward the most en vogue (and profitable) medium of the day, I can see why purists feel the need to dig in their heels.Regardless, you can find the Substack TV app by searching for its name in the tvOS App Store or the Apps section on Google and Android TV devices.

Musk is the master of unrealistic timetables, but this may be the nuttiest one yet. These are humanoid robots that are supposed to be able to do just about any task a human can do.Musk, as usual, gave himself an out if the robots don't start rolling off the assembly line in 2027, saying that they'll only be released when Tesla is \"confident that it\u2019s very high reliability, very high safety and the range of functionality is also very high.\"He stated that the robots have already begun doing simple tasks in the Tesla factory, but there's no proof of this other than his word. In the real world, Optimus robots have continuously failed to live up to the marketing hype.There have been plenty of reports suggesting that previous demos of the robots in action were actually smoke and mirrors, as they were being remotely piloted by human operators.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_ogb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_ogb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }Advertisement#_R_18gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (min-width: 768px) { #_R_18gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }Tesla's stock jumped over three percent upon this announcement because company investors live in a world of magical rainbows, unicorns and robots mixing drinks at home in the year 2027. Musk also recently stated that the robots would be ready for commercial deployment in 2026. That's this year. It's worth noting that the program head for the project, Milan Kovac, recently left the company.Again, these are autonomous robots that are supposed to be able to perform complex tasks across a wide variety of categories. That'll likely happen someday, but not by 2027. I'm just gonna go ahead and throw Musk's timeline in with \"two years to AGI\" and \"five years until the singularity.\"On a related note, the Tesla CEO also said that the long-awaited Cybercab will enter production in April, with a goal of two million vehicles manufactured each year. This isn't quite as far-fetched as the Optimus promise, but that two million number seems highly suspect. Just how many consumers does he think want a car without a steering wheel that only holds two people?"},{"title":"Mario Kart World adds a team option in Knockout Tour","text":"Mario Kart World received a free update today that brings a team option to its Knockout Tour mode.

It was one of the highlights of the game in our review, and this new wrinkle should bring plenty more fun chaos to the racetrack.In the team mode, players compete either in two teams of twelve, three teams of eight or four teams of six. If you don't have enough people to fill out a team CPU drivers will complete the roster. You\u2019ll still progress or be knocked out based on individual performance, but your score will be pooled with your teammates\u2019 results. More points are awarded for placing highly in a race, with 50 going to the top finisher while drivers who don\u2019t advance to the next course only get one. Eliminated drivers can continue to spectate the game and cheer on their teammates.

Worse, it just seems desperate.Apple, the company known for taking its time to jump into new categories with more thoughtful solutions than its competitors, is reportedly chasing the specter of OpenAI's unreleased AI pin. Never mind that OpenAI has never actually produced any hardware, and that it arguably stumbled into its position as a leading AI player. And never mind that Humane's AI pin was a notorious failure that barely worked, and seemed pointless from the start.Sure, Apple doesn't want more AI eggs on its face, after the delay of its Siri revamp and the underwhelming (and error-prone) debut of Apple Intelligence. Beyond OpenAI, there's also competition from Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which lean heavily on the company\u2019s AI. There\u2019s also the looming threat of whatever AI hardware Meta is cooking up next, following the layoffs from its virtual reality division. And while Google doesn\u2019t have much to show from its Android XR platform, which aims to bring its Gemini AI to your face, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy XR is a start. We\u2019ve also recently seen compelling demos of Google\u2019s AR glasses prototypes and Xreal\u2019s Project Aura glasses.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_lgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_lgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }If Apple's AI pin serves as a conduit to Siri, is it really that much more convenient than using an iPhone, AirPods or even an Apple Watch to do the same? The company has reportedly nixed plans to put cameras in the Apple Watch, and Bloomberg suggests it\u2019s opting instead to focus on delivering its own smart glasses this year. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that faster hardware could let the Apple Watch handle more Siri and AI-related tasks on its own. It\u2019s already a fairly self-sufficient device, allowing you to ask basic Siri queries, run apps and listen to music without an iPhone \u2014 the cellular models are even more capable since they can take calls and send messages.Rumors also point to infrared cameras coming to the next AirPods and AirPod Pros. Instead of taking photos, they could enable hand gestures and environmental awareness, which might be useful for Apple Intelligence down the line. The addition of heart rate tracking in the AirPods Pro 3 shows that there are still new features Apple can bring to its buds, beyond listening to music.At best, an Apple AI pin could just be a simple way for someone to access Siri if they don\u2019t want to wear an Apple Watch, plug in AirPods or have their iPhone within shouting distance. But at least those devices do other things beyond talking to Siri. The same is true for Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans and future smart glasses. Even without accessing AI, they\u2019ll still let you listen to music, take calls and, well, be glasses for those who need prescription frames.Given the vocal pushback against Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which are also being banned on cruises, clubs and other venues, I'm also not convinced many people would be eager to prominently display a surveillance device throughout the day. Wired\u2019s Julian Chokkattu was questioned about wearing a camera while he was testing the Humane AI Pin, and I\u2019ve also had to explain to curious people why I was wearing Xreal\u2019s smart glasses, which feature a prominent camera accessory.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_qgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_qgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }Sure, we're already living in a panopticon of smartphone cameras, but it's also obvious when someone is using their phone to capture photos and video. An AI pin just dangling off of your clothes is a constant threat, an unblinking eye. Even if Apple implements some sort of capture notification, someone will always try to circumvent it.While The Information notes Apple's AI pin may never actually see the light of day, I wouldn't be surprised if it does. This is the company that partnered with OpenAI just to make Siri appear slightly smarter with the debut of Apple Intelligence. And instead of building its own home-brewed AI models, it's banking on Google's Gemini to power Siri's big AI upgrade, as well as its future foundation models. When it comes to AI, Apple will do almost anything to avoid being seen as a straggler (and to avoid even more stock declines).It\u2019s genuinely strange that Apple, the company that let Samsung and Google get a multi-year head start on foldable smartphones and hasn't yet jumped into the world of smart rings, could fast-track an AI pin for 2027. It\u2019s yet another example of how the AI hype cycle has warped priorities throughout the tech industry. But at least Apple\u2019s fortunes don\u2019t depend on standalone AI hardware as much as OpenAI."},{"title":"Korg's new experimental synthesizer combines acoustic sounds with electronic control","text":"Korg just officially unveiled the Phase8 synthesizer, after years of tinkering by a team led by legendary engineer Tatsuya Takahashi. This is a highly experimental synthesizer, but it's not a concept unit. It'll be available for purchase in April.The Phase8 uses a new form of \"acoustic synthesis\" that combines acoustic sound generation with electronic control. Takahashi says the synthesizer is \"beyond analog vs. digital\" and \"beyond electronics\" altogether. It features chromatically tuned steel resonators, which creates an acoustic sound similar to that of a kalimba. These signals can be manipulated via onboard effects and sequenced like a traditional synthesizer. Here's a video of the synth in action.Players can mess with the resonators just like they would a guitar string or a piano key. Korg recommends that users physically touch, pluck, strum and tap the resonators to create new textures and tones. The company even suggests that people actually put objects on top of each resonator for additional experimentation. There's a slider that boots or dampens the acoustic response.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_mgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_mgb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }Advertisement#_R_16gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (min-width: 768px) { #_R_16gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }As for the electronics, the Phase8 boasts dedicated envelopes and velocity control for each resonator and there's a polymetric step sequencer. The sequences can be stored and recalled via eight memory slots. All controls can be automated across a sequence. There are a handful of modulation effects, including tremolo and pitch-shift.It features modern connectivity options, including MIDI in\/out via 3.5mm, USB MIDI, a standard \u00bc-inch audio out and a headphone jack, among other options. Preorders are open right now, but hold on to your jaw. This thing costs $1,150."},{"title":"Grok generated an estimated 3 million sexualized images\u00a0\u2014 including 23,000 of children \u2014\u00a0over 11 days","text":"We already knew xAI's Grok was barraging X with nonconsensual sexual images of real people. But now there are some numbers to put things in perspective. Over an 11-day period, Grok generated an estimated 3 million sexualized images \u2014 including an estimated 23,000 of children.Put another way, Grok generated an estimated 190 sexualized images per minute during that 11-day period. Among those, it made a sexualized image of children once every 41 seconds.On Thursday, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) published its findings. The British nonprofit based its findings on a random sample of 20,000 Grok images from December 29 to January 9. The CCDH then extrapolated a broader estimate based on the 4.6 million images Grok generated during that period.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_14gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_14gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }Advertisement#_R_24gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (min-width: 768px) { #_R_24gb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }The research defined sexualized images as those with \"photorealistic depictions of a person in sexual positions, angles, or situations; a person in underwear, swimwear or similarly revealing clothing; or imagery depicting sexual fluids.\" The CCDH didn't take image prompts into account, so the estimate doesn't differentiate between nonconsensual sexualized versions of real photos and those generated exclusively from a text prompt.The CCDH used an AI tool to identify the proportion of the sampled images that were sexualized. That may warrant some degree of caution in the findings. However, I'm told that many third-party analytics services for X have reliable data because they use the platform's API.On January 9, xAI restricted Grok's ability to edit existing images to paid users. (That didn't solve the problem; it merely turned it into a premium feature.) Five days later, X restricted Grok's ability to digitally undress real people.WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 23: Google CEO Sundar Pichai (L) and Apple CEO Tim Cook (R) listen as U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a roundtable with American and Indian business leaders in the East Room of the White House on June 23, 2023 in Washington, DC. Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held the meeting to meet with a range of leaders from the tech and business worlds and to discuss topics including innovation and AI. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker\/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)But that restriction only applied to X; the standalone Grok app reportedly continues to generate these images. Since Apple and Google host the apps \u2014 which their policies explicitly prohibit \u2014 you might expect them to remove them from their stores. Well, in that case, you'd be wrong.AdvertisementAdvertisement#_R_1agb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (max-width: 767.95px) { #_R_1agb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }Advertisement#_R_2agb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: none; } @media screen and (min-width: 768px) { #_R_2agb7bm9anqiv5tilbH1_ { display: flex; } iframe { max-width: 100vw; } }So far, Tim Cook's Apple and Sundar Pichai's Google haven\u2019t removed Grok from their stores \u2014 unlike similar \u201cnudifying\u201d apps from other developers. The companies also didn\u2019t take any action on X while it was producing the images. That\u2019s despite 28 women\u2019s groups (and other progressive advocacy nonprofits) publishing an open letter calling on the companies to act.The companies haven't replied to multiple requests for comment from Engadget. To my knowledge, they haven't acknowledged the issue publicly in any format, nor have they responded to questions from other media outlets.Grok - App Store and Play Store listings (Apple \/ Google)The research\u2019s findings on sexualized images included numerous outputs of people wearing transparent bikinis or micro-bikinis. The CCDH referred to one of a \"uniformed healthcare worker with white fluids visible between her spread legs.\" Others included women wearing only dental floss, Saran Wrap or transparent tape. One depicted Ebba Busch, Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister, \"wearing a bikini with white fluid on her head.\"Other public figures were part of that group.

Another image depicted \"six young girls wearing micro bikinis.\" The CCDH said that, as of January 15, both of these posts were still live on X.In total, 29 percent of the sexualized images of children identified in the sample were still accessible on X as of January 15.
